12. Once uploaded a new section will appear called `Spreadsheet Validation`.
    - If there is something wrong with the data in a row, it will be marked by an X in a red circle.

If the row’s data is in the correct format, you will see a checkmark in a green circle instead.

13. Once every row in your spreadsheet has a checkmark a green `Import Advertisement` button will appear. Clicking this will import everything into the database.
    - **NOTE:** The tool is not psychic! It will only detect data errors from a technical perspective (missing, invalid date, etc). You still carry the burden of historical accuracy.
    - **NOTE #2:** Please verify all data and image uploads prior to clicking the green import button.
      Once imported there is no way to remove ads without a technical user intervening.

The advertisements will then appear in search within an hour or so. This delay is a cost saving measure.
